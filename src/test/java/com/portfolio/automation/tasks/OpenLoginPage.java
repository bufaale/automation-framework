 * ðŸ§  SOLID Principle - SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):
 * This task does one thing only â€” it opens a specific URL.
 *
 * ðŸ”“ OCP (Open/Closed Principle):
 * The task is closed for modification but open for extension, for example:
 * it could be extended to navigate through an intermediate page, or log page open events,
 * without modifying its core behavior.
 *
 * ðŸ§± OOP - Encapsulation:
 * The URL is hidden within a readable, reusable action, improving test readability.
